                <p>
                    Classes are a key part to OOP, they should be designed to represent the functionality of a single
                    object. If a class gets too long there is a strong chance that the class is breaking one of the core
                    ideas of a class, to represent a single object. <b>Long classes</b> can often be split up into
                    smaller
                    classes which better represents the objects functionality.

                <h3>Long IDs</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    This one's a bit topical. Some will argue that there's nothing wrong with having <b>long ids</b>
                    and
                    there's reason for it. If the name is carrying essential information to the variable/method then yes
                    a
                    <b>long name</b> is ok, but <b>long ids</b> can be an indication of a violation of the single
                    responsibility principle, i.e. methods should only perform one specific task.

                <p>
                    Since it's easier to write code than read it, this <i>smell</i> can go unnoticed until a method
                    becomes
                    obscenely long. <b>Long methods</b> are the perfect hiding place for duplicate code, so there's no
                    shame
                    in splitting up medium to large methods into smaller ones. Just give them meaningful names and no
                    one
                    will give them a second glance.

                <h3>Long Parameter List</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    While not always a bad code smell, sometimes having a <b>long list of parameters</b> for a method
                    call
                    can be a sign that your code can be changed around to more readable and shorter. <b>Long parameter
                    lists</b> can be a byproduct of trying to make classes more independent of each other. While this
                    does
                    reduce dependency, it increases the number of parameters needed for the method call. As the number
                    of
                    parameters increases, the harder it becomes to use and read.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    If the parameters are result of method calls then the method calls can be moved inside the method
                    call
                    itself. Also if the parameters are the received from another object, this object can be passed to
                    the
                    method and its data retrieved inside the method. Reducing the length of parameter lists makes code
                    more
                    readable, shorter and may possible reveal unnoticed duplicate code elsewhere.

                    <i>Note: Don't get rid of parameters from a method just for the sake of doing so, you don't want to

                <h3>Primitive Obsession</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Primitive Obsession can be seen when primitive types are used instead of small objects for simple
                    tasks
                    such as special strings, ranges, etc. This code smell can occur as the result of brief lapses in the
                    programmers thought process when they decide to use a primitive field for storing some data. This
                    then
                    happens multiple times and next thing classes are riddled with primitives instead of objects.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    If there is a variety of primitive fields, it may be possible to logically group them into a class.
                    It
                    also may be possible to move the code that operates on these fields into the newly created class as
                    well. Reducing the number of primitives makes code more flexible and makes the code more
                    understandable
                    and organised.

                A disposable is something pointless and unneeded whose absence would make

                    Overcomplicated logic in code can often be seen in the shape of an <b>arrowhead</b>. Overly
                    complicated logic makes code harder to understand and maintain so keeping logic conditions
                    concise and clear is really important to writing good code.

                    A small class, which may not have too much function or use to the overall functionality of the

                <p>
                    This one comes from the excessive use of <b>"literals"</b>. These should be coded as named constants,
                    to improve readability and to avoid programming errors. Additions, <b>"literals"</b> can be and
                    should be externalized into resource files/scripts, or other data storage such as databases where
                    possible, with the ability to facilitate localization of software of where it's intended to be
                    deployed.
                    <br/>
                    Example, <b>"literals"</b> above should be replaced by a constant variable <b>LITERALS</b>.

                <h3>Data Class</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    A <b>Data Class</b> refers to a class that contains only fields and crude methods for accessing
                    them.
                    These are simply containers for data used by other classes. They don't contain any additional
                    functionality and can't independently operate on the data that they own. In OOP the true power of
                    objects is that they can contain behavior types or operations on their data.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    One of the best solutions to this code smell is <b>Encapsulation</b>. If a class contains public
                    fields
                    then use encapsulation to prevent direct access to the field and require access via a getter and
                    setter
                    only. Also review the client code that uses the <b>Data Class</b>. You may find functionality that
                    would
                    be better located in the <b>Data Class</b> itself. If this is the case then just move migrate
                    functionality to the data class. After the class has been filled with well thought-out methods you
                    can
                    get rid of some of the old methods for data access that give overly broad access to the class data,
                    e.g.
                    remove setter methods that aren't used etc..

            <div id="dataHiding">
                <h3>Violations of Data Hiding</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    This one comes from bad encapsulation of a class. This is a huge OOP violation which may allow other
                    classes to access fields and methods which they shouldn't be.
                    <br>
                    It's an easy fix, just make them private!

                        These smells result in excessive coupling between classes or show what happens when coupling is replaced

                        excessive delegation.

                        <p>
                            <b>Feature Envy</b> is a code smell which can occur in methods. A method has <b>Feature Envy</b> on
                            another class if it uses more features ( i.e. fields and methods) of another class more than its
                            own.
                            <b>Feature Envy</b> can be avoided simply by moving the methods to the preferred class, i.e. the
                            class
                            it is envious of.

                        <p>
                            <b>Message chains</b> occur when a client requests another object, which in turn requests from
                            another

                        <p>
                            These chains highlight how dependent the client on navigating the class structure. If a change is
                            made
                            to these relationships between classes then the client requires modifying.

                        <p>
                            <b>Message chains</b> can be removed by adding a new method to the second object in the chain (Class
                            A)
                            which delegates the call to the next object in the chain(Class B). Now the client doesn't know
                            anything
                            about, or depend on Class B.

                        <p>
                            By avoiding <b>message chaining</b> it makes it easier to maintain the client code as the less the
                            client knows about its relationship to other objects the easier it is to make changes as classes are
                            less dependent on each other.
